# TODO
This is where I plan on dumping ideas, both undeveloped and developed, into

  * Settings:
    I would like to create a little settings menu with features like changing the theme
  * Custom CSS and JS files
  * Markdown style syntax of bold and italic text (maybe big text too)
  * Picture support
  * Status codes (We need these in main.go)
  * Possibly an electron app that works off of this server but is adapted to be tied to one journal
