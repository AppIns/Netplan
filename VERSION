0.5.2-beta (serialized 26)
---
The serialized number should be incremented every time a git commit is made
(If the commit affects any server files). This file will be compared to check if the
server is running an up to date version.

Past number updates:
  - 0.2-beta s 0: Include versioning
  - 0.3-beta s 3: Change themes a lot and add editable titles
  - 0.4-beta s 6: Started work on a bar and changed "blue" to "color"
  - 0.5-beta s 14: Created a caching system that decreases hard drive usage
  - 0.5.1-beta s 16: Themes are fixed and work again
  - 0.5.2-beta s 18: Added bold, italic, and underline buttons.

Please message me if the server seems to be behind by a major update!
