0.3-beta (serialized 3)
---
The serialized number should be incremented every time a git commit is made
(If the commit is important). This file will be compared to check if the
server is running an up to date version.

Past major updates:
  - 0.2-beta s 0: Include versioning
  - 0.3-beta s 3: Change themes a lot and add editable titles

Please message me if the server seems to be behind by a major update!
