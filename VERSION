0.5.1-beta (serialized 16)
---
The serialized number should be incremented every time a git commit is made
(If the commit is important). This file will be compared to check if the
server is running an up to date version.

Past number updates:
  - 0.2-beta s 0: Include versioning
  - 0.3-beta s 3: Change themes a lot and add editable titles
  - 0.4-beta s 6: Started work on a bar and changed "blue" to "color"
  - 0.5-beta s 14: Created a caching system that decreases hard drive usage
  - 0.5.1-beta s 16: Themes are fixed and work again

Please message me if the server seems to be behind by a major update!
